Tries to fill a cross-word with only simple words.

Make a cross-word shape like this:

????
???.
.???
????

Use . for black boxes, ? for letters cross-fill will fill in,
and a lower-case letter for ready-filled letters.

It might not finish if it's too hard! Try not to put words close
around each other on all sides.

Use like this:

./cross-fill < my-cross-word-shape

Puts out an answer like this.

some
one.
.tea
lots

1 ACROSS: some ()
4 ACROSS: one ()
5 ACROSS: tea (ate/eat)
7 ACROSS: lots (lost)
1 DOWN: so ()
2 DOWN: onto ()
3 DOWN: meet ()
6 DOWN: as ()

If you like part of the answer but not the rest, try taking the answer
and changing parts to ? before running again.
